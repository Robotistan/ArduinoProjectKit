## Analog Reading and Serial Communication With Arduino Details
In this application, we want to light up intermediate colors besides full brÄ±ghtness. We need to use PWM to turn the LED on to the desired brightness level. Since PWM feature is present in certain legs(3,5,6,9,10,11), we will pay attention to use these legs when making connections.
Let's set up circuit and continue with coding.
